# ubuntu-dotfile-plus

**ubuntu-dotfile-plus** is a turnkey bootstrap kit for fresh Ubuntu systems. It merges traditional *dotfiles* with modular postâ€‘installation scripts so you can transform a vanilla machine into a fullyâ€‘equipped development workstation in minutesâ€”consistently and repeatably.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Oneâ€‘command provisioning** â€“ install packages, apply system tweaks, and symlink personalized config files with a single script.
* **User-friendly execution** â€“ can be run as a regular user; sudo privileges are requested only when needed.
* **Curated dotfiles** â€“ `bash`/`zsh`, `git`, `vim`/`neovim`, `tmux`, `ssh`, and more, all versionâ€‘controlled.
* **Modular scripts** â€“ independent install modules (e.g. `docker`, `samba`, `devtools`) that you can turn on/off.
* **Idempotent by design** â€“ safe to reâ€‘run; existing settings are detected before modification.
* **Ubuntuâ€‘focused** â€“ tuned for the latest LTS release, but compatible with most Debianâ€‘based distros.
* **Rollback safety** â€“ critical files are automatically backed up before changes are applied.
* **Starship Prompt** â€“ modern cross-shell prompt with Gruvbox theme, Git status, language detection, and more.

### Individual Component Installation

If you prefer to install specific components only:

#### Starship Prompt

The **Starship Prompt** is a modern, blazing-fast cross-shell prompt with a custom Gruvbox Dark theme:

**Features:**
* **OS Icon** â€“ Displays your operating system with a beautiful icon
* **User/Host Info** â€“ Shows username@hostname with root user highlighted differently
* **Current Directory** â€“ Smart path truncation with icon substitutions
* **Git Integration** â€“ Branch name and status with color-coded indicators
* **Language Detection** â€“ Automatic detection and version display for:
  * Python, Node.js, Rust, Go, Java, C/C++, PHP, Kotlin, Haskell
* **Environment Detection** â€“ Shows Docker context, Conda/Pixi environments
* **Time Display** â€“ Current time in HH:MM format
* **Exit Status** â€“ Visual indicator for command success (âž¤) or failure
* **Gruvbox Theme** â€“ Beautiful color scheme that's easy on the eyes

**Installation:**
```bash
# Clone the repo first
git clone https://github.com/hulryung/ubuntu-dotfile-plus.git
cd ubuntu-dotfile-plus/scripts
./install_starship.sh
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Install Starship
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh

# Copy configuration
mkdir -p ~/.config
cp config/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml

# Add to your .bashrc
echo 'eval "$(starship init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Samba Share Setup

`setup_samba_share.sh` shares the *current* user's home directory (`/home/<user>`) over Samba with **read/write** access so that a Windows PC can access it immediately after Ubuntu installation.

**What It Does:**
1. Installs the `samba` package (if missing).
2. Backs up `/etc/samba/smb.conf` with a timestamp.
3. Ensures correct ownership of the user's home directory.
4. Appends a new share block to `smb.conf` (if it doesn't already exist).
5. Prompts you to set a Samba password for the user.
6. Restarts the `smbd` and `nmbd` services.

**Installation:**
```bash
# Clone the repo first
git clone https://github.com/hulryung/ubuntu-dotfile-plus.git
cd ubuntu-dotfile-plus/scripts
bash setup_samba_share.sh
```

After the script finishes, access the share from Windows:
`\\<Ubuntu_IP>\<username>` â€” log in with the same username and the Samba password you just set.

> **Firewall tip** â€“ If UFW is enabled, open ports 137â€“139 and 445:
>
> ```bash
> sudo ufw allow samba
> ```
