## Included Script Spotlight: `setup_samba_share.sh`

`setup_samba_share.sh` shares the *current* user's home directory (`/home/<user>`) over Samba with **read/write** access so that a Windows PC can access it immediately after Ubuntu installation.

### What It Does

1. Installs the `samba` package (if missing).
2. Backs up `/etc/samba/smb.conf` with a timestamp.
3. Ensures correct ownership of the user's home directory.
4. Appends a new share block to `smb.conf` (if it doesn't already exist).
5. Prompts you to set a Samba password for the user.
6. Restarts the `smbd` and `nmbd` services.

### How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repo and run the script (sudo will be requested if needed)
cd ubuntu-dotfile-plus/scripts
bash setup_samba_share.sh
```

After the script finishes, access the share from Windows:
`\\<Ubuntu_IP>\<username>` ‚Äî log in with the same username and the Samba password you just set.

> **Firewall tip** ‚Äì If UFW is enabled, open ports 137‚Äì139 and 445:
>
> ```bash
> sudo ufw allow samba
> ```

## Quick Start (Full Bootstrap)

```bash
# 1. Grab the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your‚Äëuser>/ubuntu-dotfile-plus.git
cd ubuntu-dotfile-plus

# 2. Provision the system (sudo will be requested when needed)
./bootstrap.sh
```

Log out/in (or reboot) once the script completes to load your new shell environment.
